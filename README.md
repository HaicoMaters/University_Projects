# **University Projects**
Place to keep a collection of the most important projects from university and a short explanation of each project folder below.

## *Fluid dynamics Project:*
An implementation of Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics in Unity3D created for my dissertation. Showcases usage of parallel computing on the GPU using HLSL shade language. The dissertation included showcases more detail in terms of the techniques, theory and results behind it.

## *Small Space Game Made in Unity:*
Consists of a small game focused on game physics and a larger game focusing on game AI and pathfinding. Larger game AI includes implementations of AI by using MinMax with in particular a MaxN algorithm being used to allow for multiple agents to choose the best moves they can make based on the best actions a couple turns ahead.

## *Wildlife Spotting Android Application:*
A Wildlife spotting app where users can upload animals found on a map for others nearby to be able to view and also find.

A team software development project developed in Java using Maven and Android Studio with a small software engineering team to create android application, through software engineering phases from requirements analysis to the design and development.


**The parts of the application I am responsible for are shown in the way files are authored but some of my contributions can be summarized as:**

•	Handled entire MariaDB database adding CRUD operations using Hibernate, in Java creating a server which was formerly hosted on the university network to transfer information between the database and the application and handled the interactions between server, and database and server and application.

•	Used the Wikipedia API to extract basic animal information in Json format for application to receive.

•	Added a minor Facebook integration into the app to be able to share animals found with a photo.

## *C Projects:*

Two projects written in C one involving inter-process communcation and one involving networking using a socket based solution for a udp data transfer.

Each project was straightforward in terms of direction where all was required was to write functions to satisfy the requirements in the relvant header file while making certain that memory leaks are guarded against and the C library functions are saftely used and chosen.

## *Lottery Web App:*

From some original code for a webpage, additional features mostly focused around security were added. (Both original provided code and final application available)

**The Following was added:**

•	Input Validation for registration

•	Custom error pages (e.g. 404/403)

•	Database Encryption/Hashing

•	Login page

•	Authentication for login (Correct credentials, reCAPTCHA, time-based pin, limited login attempts)

•	Ability to log out

•	Correct authorisation, users can only see what they allowed

•	Role Based Access Control (Admin, User and Logged out)

•	Logging of user activity (Registration and login. Log the Time, Username and IP. Also, log failed login attempts and invalid page access attempts)

•	Cryptographically secure number generation for the lottery

•	Security Headers

## *Unity Graphics Project:*
A small graphics simulation made in unity comprised of HLSL shaders and C# code. 

A word document is contained in the folder which shows some screenshots and better explanation of features in the scene.
